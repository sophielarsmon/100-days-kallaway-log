100 days until my baby's due-date; 100 days to learn how to code :)

Inspired by my colleague awalsh3 who has recently graduated from a Coding Bootcamp at Le Wagon, I've decided to properly commit to giving coding a crack. We are a small team at Any One Thing and my remit as Artistic Director of the company has been - to date - to focus on the theatre side of things (I'm a theatre director by day). But I want to be more useful to the overall running of the business and I figured a way I could be more useful to my team is to at least understand the basics of coding. 

We discovered on a team call yesterday that my second son is due in exactly 100 days time, so it seems like an ideal (or slightly bonkers?) time to start something I've been meaning to do in over a year now: learn how to code. My first son was born exactly on his due date which is pretty rare. Let's see if I manage to learn the basics before Number 2 arrives.

Here we go... Baby steps...!
