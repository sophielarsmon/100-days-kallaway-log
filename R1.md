## Log of #100DaysOfCode 

### Day 1: Saturday 10 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started at the very beginning - a very good place to start according to Julie Andrews. I set up a repository on GitHub - though I don't think I've managed to link this to that and I started at the beginning of the programme at FreeCodeCamp.org where I was walked through some basic HTML stuff. 

**Thoughts:** I am brand spanking new to this and don't really know what I'm doing. As a perfectionist, this stresses me out, but I am aware that it's all part of the learning, so I'm just going to go with it.


**Link to work:** I'm not really sure what I'd link to as I'm starting at the beginning of FreeCodeCamp and don't really have anything to show, so I think I'll just delete this part of Kallaway's template log for now (until I have something to show).



### Day 2: Sunday 11 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Had every intention of carrying on with HTML Basics today but literally did not have a spare hour until gone 11pm at night, at which point I crashed out in my son's bed having transferred him there from the car (we'd watched the tragedy that was the England vs Italy Euro 2020 Finals at my in-law's). Will make up for it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Guilty. Am I really up to this?



### Day 3: Monday 12 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple of hours today to make up for yesterday's failed attempt. Completed Basic HTML & HTML 5 and made a start on Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Making slow progress, but must confess that I don't know how much of this is going in. I mean, I can follow instructions and work things out when I'm in an exercise, but not sure I'd recall what to do if faced with a blank canvas... Is this normal?!



### Day 4: Tuesday 13 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS and have started to keep this log. I'm not sure if I've actually forked Kallaway's repo correctly, and I'm very very sorry if I've mucked things up his end.

**Thoughts:** I really am such a newbie to this. I hope I'm not making a complete tit of myself!


### Day 5: Wednesday 14 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: More CSS today. Have started doing the Applied Visual Design module within the Responsive Web Design course and I'm rather enjoying it :) Very cool to start playing with colours and thinking about colour theory. As an artist who aspires to make work online, this is going to be super relevant.

**Thoughts:** I like that the community on twitter is encouraging and answers questions when you put them out there. 


### Day 6: Thursday 15 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Sat outside a cafe today whilst baby no. 1 napped and sneaked my hour in. More on CSS today and started experimenting with some very basic animation which was satisying!

**Thoughts:** It can be incredibly satisfying seeing things come to life after I've coded it. But I'm still not sure any of this is going IN?!


### Day 7: Friday 16 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'Applied Visual Design' module and moved onto the 'Applied Accessibility' one. 

**Thoughts:** Pleased to have completed a whole week!


### Day 8: Saturday 17 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Zero :( My partner was working all weekend and the little guy decided not to nap this afternoon (too hot?) so I didn't get a clear hour to crack on with coding. Also managed to fall asleep when I put him down to bed, so sadly nothing acheived today. Will need to catch up tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Bit bummed out, but gotta cut myself some slack. Toddler + solo-parenting + hottest day of the year so far + 6 months pregnant = not going to get my coding done every day!


### Day 9: Sunday 18 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Ah man.... zero again.

**Thoughts:** Same issue as yesterday. Going to have to do a marathon session tomorrow to catch up!


### Day 10: Monday 19 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent the first hour cracking on with the 'Applied Accessibility' module. Great that we're getting taught this so early on in the course. Spent the second hour completing this module and then doing the next module 'Responsive Web Design Principles'.

**Thoughts:** Particularly enjoying how CSS can help with the accessibility of a page. Have only managed to catch up on one weekend day today; will have to do the other one tomorrow.


### Day 11: Tuesday 20 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent the first hour working on the 'CSS Flexbox' Module and the 'CSS Grid' Module

**Thoughts:** The catch up continues... still need to fit in my missed Sunday hour.... argh!


### Day 12: Wednesday 21 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the'CSS Grid' Module and have now moved onto the first challenge, which is to build a Tribute Page utilising many of the html & css skills we've learnt thus far. 

**Thoughts:** Glad to be putting things into practice, but also realising quite how little actually 'in'. This will be most useful if I allow this Tribute Page challenge to be an opportunity to try and let several things settle. Fun to do some research on women in tech too. I've deicded to make the Tribute Page for Ava Lovelace, and in so doing have come across a whole range of current-day kick-ass women including Reshma Saujani, Susan Wojcicki, Ellen K. Pao, Danah Boyd, Kimberly Bryant, Kate Crawford, Dr. Fei-Fei Li, Katie Moussouris, Cathy Hackl & Joanna Stern. Inspiring stuff.



### Days 13-17: Thursday 22 July - Monday 26 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: First challenge set by FreeCode Camp - code a Tribtue Page - completed.  

**Thoughts:** In all honesty, days 14, 15 & 16 didn't happen as I was in a field with my son sans laptop and with dodgy wifi. And I know I'm not going to make up those hours over the next few days as other things mount up. BUT, feeling happy that I've put something (albeit super simple) into the world. Thank you Ada Lovelace :)
