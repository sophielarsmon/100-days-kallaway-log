### Day 1: Saturday 10 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started at the very beginning - a very good place to start according to Julie Andrews. I set up a repository on GitHub - though I don't think I've managed to link this to that and I started at the beginning of the programme at FreeCodeCamp.org where I was walked through some basic HTML stuff. 

**Thoughts:** I am brand spanking new to this and don't really know what I'm doing. As a perfectionist, this stresses me out, but I am aware that it's all part of the learning, so I'm just going to go with it.


**Link to work:** I'm not really sure what I'd link to as I'm starting at the beginning of FreeCodeCamp and don't really have anything to show, so I think I'll just delete this part of Kallaway's template log for now (until I have something to show).



### Day 2: Sunday 11 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Had every intention of carrying on with HTML Basics today but literally did not have a spare hour until gone 11pm at night, at which point I crashed out in my son's bed having transferred him there from the car (we'd watched the tragedy that was the England vs Italy Euro 2020 Finals at my in-law's). Will make up for it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Guilty. Am I really up to this?



### Day 3: Monday 12 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple of hours today to make up for yesterday's failed attempt. Completed Basic HTML & HTML 5 and made a start on Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Making slow progress, but must confess that I don't know how much of this is going in. I mean, I can follow instructions and work things out when I'm in an exercise, but not sure I'd recall what to do if faced with a blank canvas... Is this normal?!



### Day 4: Tuesday 13 July 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS and have started to keep this log. I'm not sure if I've actually forked Kallaway's repo correctly, and I'm very very sorry if I've mucked things up his end.

**Thoughts:** I really am such a newbie to this. I hope I'm not making a complete tit of myself!
